# OntoUML Visual Paradigm Plugin
OntoUML plugin for Visual Paradigm

## Installing plugin
You can install this plugin by either:
* downloading the .zip and unzipping it inside Visual Paradigm's plugin folder, which is 
  * `~/.config/VisualParadigm/plugins/` in **Linux**
  * `C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\VisualParadigm\plugins\` in **Windows**
  * `~/Library/Application Support/VisualParadigm/plugins/` in **macOS**
* Using Visual Paradigm's plugin install button. Open Visual Paradigm, go into the **Help** tab and select **Install Plugin**. Select "**Install from a zip of plugin**". Click next, select the .zip file and restart Visual Paradigm after the process is done.

## How to use it
* It is recommended to create a new project (name it anything but "untitled") so all OntoUML's stereotypes are created in the scope of the project. If you don't want to create a new project, the plugin has a button to add all stereotypes to the project.

* Create a new class diagram. Set the stereotype in a class, all OntoUML's stereotypes will be in the list. Same thing for associations. The plugin's actions are in the **Plugin** tab.

* For meronymic associations, you may want to change their tagged values. To show them, right-click in the background of the class diagram area, go to **Presentation Options**, then to **Show Tagged Values**.
